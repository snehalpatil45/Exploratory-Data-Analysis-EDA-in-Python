# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis – Task 1 (Level 1)

This is my **first data analytics project** completed during my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The task focused on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a restaurant dataset using Python and key libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To clean and analyze a restaurant dataset by:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical (Yes/No) columns
- Exploring the distribution of aggregate ratings
- Visualizing the results with bar plots

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
